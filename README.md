# Welcome to GlassPy
GlassPy is a Python module for scientists working with glass materials.

## What is it?
The aim is to provide classes and functions written in Python for the materials scientists working with glass. The hope is that with an open and collaborative project, we can build a reliable toolset to support faster and reproducible research on glass materials.

## Development
GlassPy was born as a personal tool back in 2013 when I started coding with Python.
Right now, I'm sorting all my code and properly documenting it to build this Python module. My main objective is to increase the reproducibility of my research in specific and hopefully glass science in general.

## Roadmap
This repository is in its infancy. The current version is 0.1dev, which means that it is not intended for public use right now.
My objective for version 0.1 is to have working classes for the regression of nucleation density data.

## Documentation
There is no documentation right now, but all the functions have a detailed docstring.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/)

## Other python repositories for glass science
- [RelaxPy](https://github.com/Mauro-Glass-Group/RelaxPy) - Module to compute glass relaxation kinetics.
- [PyGlass](https://github.com/jrafolsr/PyGlass) - Module to simulate the specific heat signature of glasses with a specified thermal treatment following the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model.
