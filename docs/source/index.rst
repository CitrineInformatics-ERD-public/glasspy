GlassPy |version| documentation
===============================

GlassPy is a Python module for researchers working with `glass materials`_ and
`glass-forming liquids`_. The module provides classes and functions to do usual
tasks. Right now, GlassPy is focused on glass data and predictive models.
GlassPy offers a convenient way to load data from the `SciGlass database`_ into a
pandas DataFrame. GlassPy is also the home of GlassNet and ViscNet. GlassNet is
a predictive model of many glass properties. ViscNet is a predictive model of
viscosity. GlassPy is still under heavy development; changes to the API are not
only probable but expected as development continues.
